      <p> Our story begain with an simple idea. As wanting to expand Technology around our own community. We belive that we could bring Technology in Fresno. With providing technology for teenagers we are hoping of increasing the intrest of teenagers in techology. As with your support we could do much more. Not only techology for teenagers but the oppertunities and resoucres that we could offer. As like our scholarships we promote technological carrers and have the the power to impact the community and stand for change.  </p>
